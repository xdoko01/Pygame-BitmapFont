# TODO
 - [ ] correct default behavior if the character is not defined by the font
 - [x] spacing put into the constructor of the BitmFont and away from the json file = default is no spacing
 - [x] do not cut the original font picture, just save the coordinates
 - [ ] automatically recognize the format of the json file - list with separators or dict of characters
 - [x] implement the support for dict with characters
